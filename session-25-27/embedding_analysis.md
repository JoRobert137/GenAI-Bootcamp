# Module 4: Embedding Visualization & Insights

## 1. Introduction

In this module, we explored **embeddings** and their use in a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. Each document in our "database" is represented as a numeric vector, which allows us to perform **semantic search** using similarity metrics like the **dot product**.

## 2. TensorFlow Projector Visualization

We visualized the document vectors in **TensorFlow Embedding Projector**:

| Document Index | Category | Vector |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| 0 | Interaction/Color | [0.85, 0.10, 0.40] |
| 1 | Theme/Mode | [-0.90, 0.05, -0.30] |
| 2 | Code Standard/Architecture | [0.70, -0.80, -0.15] |
| 3 | Spacing/Design System | [0.10, 0.95, 0.60] |
| 4 | Data Fetching/Hooks | [0.65, -0.75, 0.20] |
| 5 | Non-technical | [-0.15, -0.10, 0.90] |

**Observations from the visualization:**

Vectors with similar categories cluster together.
Example: Code Standard/Architecture and Data Fetching/Hooks vectors are close due to technical coding context.
Non-technical content (deadlines) is far from UI or code-related vectors.
Theme/Mode (dark mode) is distinct from other technical vectors but semantically matches UI queries.

## 3. Insights

1. **Semantic Matching Works:**  
   Queries are matched to documents based on vector similarity, not exact keywords.

2. **Dot Product as Similarity:**  
   Using the dot product allows us to quantify semantic similarity: higher dot product = higher relevance.

3. **Pipeline Simulation Results:**

| Query | Expected Match |
|-------|----------------|
| How do I make the UI dark? | Theme/Mode snippet about dark mode |
| What is the standard for code structure? | Code Standard/Architecture snippet about React hooks |

4. **Next Steps for Improvement:**

Use **larger embeddings** for real-world documents (e.g., 512+ dimensions).  
Apply **cosine similarity** instead of dot product for normalized comparisons.  
Integrate with a real LLM for RAG, fetching content dynamically rather than a static array.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This RAG simulation demonstrates how embeddings enable semantic search, allowing queries to retrieve the most relevant documents even when exact words donâ€™t match. TensorFlow visualization helps us confirm semantic clusters and relevance.
