Chat transcript (July 6, 2:11 PM): "Hi, I ordered a standing fan (Order #78945) on July 1st. It was supposed to come on July 3. Still no delivery. I paid for next-day delivery. Can someone tell me what’s going on?"

Follow-up Email 1 (July 9, 10:32 AM): "Still waiting. I called your helpline, was kept on hold for 26 mins and then cut off. No one got back to me. This is not acceptable. I’ve paid ₹340 for express and now it’s the 9th. My entire week’s schedule is ruined."

Follow-up Chat (July 11, 6:05 PM): "Your agent yesterday told me the fan had been shipped. Today I got a message saying it was delivered at 2 PM. NOTHING was delivered. I was home all day. No call, no knock. This is fake delivery."

Email escalation (July 13, 8:15 AM): "Now I’m told the delivery guy left it with ‘security.’ I live in an independent house. There IS no security! You’re just making excuses. Worst customer service I’ve ever seen. Tired of explaining again and again."

Final Email (July 16, 4:52 PM): "The fan finally arrived — box looks like it was in a warzone. Fan makes weird noises and stops after 2 minutes. I give up. Return it and refund EVERYTHING. I’m done. Absolutely ridiculous process. I’m never ordering again."]
