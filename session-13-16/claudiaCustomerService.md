Chat transcript (July 6, 2:11 PM): "Hi, I ordered a standing fan (Order #78945) on July 1st. It was supposed to come on July 3. Still no delivery. I paid for next-day delivery. Can someone tell me what’s going on?"

Follow-up Email 1 (July 9, 10:32 AM): "Still waiting. I called your helpline, was kept on hold for 26 mins and then cut off. No one got back to me. This is not acceptable. I’ve paid ₹340 for express and now it’s the 9th. My entire week’s schedule is ruined."

Follow-up Chat (July 11, 6:05 PM): "Your agent yesterday told me the fan had been shipped. Today I got a message saying it was delivered at 2 PM. NOTHING was delivered. I was home all day. No call, no knock. This is fake delivery."

Email escalation (July 13, 8:15 AM): "Now I’m told the delivery guy left it with ‘security.’ I live in an independent house. There IS no security! You’re just making excuses. Worst customer service I’ve ever seen. Tired of explaining again and again."

Final Email (July 16, 4:52 PM): "The fan finally arrived — box looks like it was in a warzone. Fan makes weird noises and stops after 2 minutes. I give up. Return it and refund EVERYTHING. I’m done. Absolutely ridiculous process. I’m never ordering again."
Subject: Regarding Your Escalation Ticket #452017 – Your Recent Order and Service Experience

Dear S. Ramesh,

Please accept my sincerest apologies for the utterly unacceptable experience you have endured with your recent order (Order #78945) and our customer service. On behalf of the entire team, I am deeply sorry for the significant distress, wasted time, and profound disappointment this situation has caused.

We acknowledge the comprehensive breakdown in service, beginning with a significant delay in the delivery of your standing fan, despite paying for express shipping. This was compounded by poor communication, including unanswered calls and unfulfilled promises. The false delivery claim was a clear breach of trust, followed by an equally untrue explanation regarding "security." To then finally receive a damaged product that is not functioning correctly is simply inexcusable and represents a complete failure on our part to meet even basic expectations.

I understand your frustration, distrust, and disappointment are entirely justified. It is deeply concerning to hear that you have been forced to repeatedly explain these issues, and I assure you that we are taking full responsibility for this series of errors. We truly regret that your experience has led you to this point.

For clarity and our internal review, here is a summary of the incidents:

Date	Incident
July 3, 2025	Original expected delivery date (Order #78945).
July 6, 2025	Initial inquiry about delayed delivery; fan not received.
July 9, 2025	Follow-up on delayed delivery; poor communication/customer service experience.
July 11, 2025	False delivery claim made.
July 13, 2025	Unsubstantiated "delivered to security" claim.
July 16, 2025	Damaged fan received; product not functioning as expected.
To rectify this situation and restore your faith in our service, we propose the following multi-step resolution plan:

Full Refund: We will process a complete refund for your Order #78945, including the express delivery charges of ₹340, immediately. You should see this reflected in your account within 3-5 business days.
Hassle-Free Return: We will arrange for a special pickup of the damaged fan from your address at your earliest convenience, completely free of charge. You do not need to package it further. Our team will contact you within 24 hours to schedule this.
Goodwill Gesture: As a further apology for the immense inconvenience and poor experience, we will issue a ₹500 credit to your account, valid for your next purchase with us, should you choose to use it.
Internal Review & Action: This entire incident will undergo a thorough internal investigation to identify root causes and implement corrective measures across our delivery and customer service processes to prevent recurrence.
We are committed to making this right for you. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly if you have any further questions or require additional assistance.

Sincerely,
