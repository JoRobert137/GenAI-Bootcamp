Prompt - In seven days I want to learn backend development.I have only 6hours a day. Give me a study planner

Got it! You want to learn backend development in 7 days with 6 hours/day. That‚Äôs tight, but we can make a focused crash plan covering essential concepts and practical work. I‚Äôll structure it for maximum learning in minimal time. I assume you know some programming basics (like Python or JavaScript).

Here‚Äôs a 7-day backend learning plan:


---

Day 1: Backend Fundamentals & Environment Setup (6h)

Goal: Understand what backend does and set up your workspace.

1h: Backend vs Frontend overview; learn about servers, APIs, databases.

2h: Install tools: Node.js + Express (JS) or Python + Flask/Django.

2h: Learn folder structure, routing, basic HTTP methods (GET, POST).

1h: Build your first ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù backend API and test with Postman.



---

Day 2: Working with APIs (6h)

Goal: Learn how backend communicates via APIs.

1h: HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) & status codes.

2h: Create RESTful APIs for simple resources (e.g., users, products).

2h: Test APIs with Postman / curl.

1h: Understand JSON format and sending/receiving JSON data.



---

Day 3: Databases (6h)

Goal: Learn to store and retrieve data.

2h: Basics of SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB).

2h: Connect your backend to a database.

1h: CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete data via API.

1h: Practice: Build a small ‚ÄúTodo App‚Äù backend storing tasks in DB.



---

Day 4: Authentication & Authorization (6h)

Goal: Learn how to manage users securely.

1h: Difference between auth & authz.

2h: Implement user registration & login.

2h: Use JWT tokens / sessions for authentication.

1h: Test login flow with Postman.



---

Day 5: Advanced Backend Concepts (6h)

Goal: Level up your backend skills.

1h: Middleware, error handling, and validations.

2h: Environment variables & configuration for different environments.

1h: Logging and debugging your backend.

2h: Optional: File uploads / simple email sending feature.



---

Day 6: Integrating Frontend & Deployment Basics (6h)

Goal: Make your backend production-ready.

2h: Connect backend to a simple frontend (HTML/React).

2h: Learn basics of deployment (Render, Vercel, Heroku, or AWS).

1h: Test your backend online.

1h: Understand basics of version control (Git + GitHub).



---

Day 7: Project Day (6h)

Goal: Build a mini project to consolidate learning.

Ideas:

Todo App with user authentication

Blog API with posts, users, comments

E-commerce API with products and orders


Tasks:

Build full CRUD backend

Connect to database

Implement authentication

Test everything end-to-end

üí° Tips to maximize learning in 6h/day:

Use 1h focus blocks with 10-min breaks.

Practice code while learning; don‚Äôt just watch tutorials.

Use Postman / Insomnia to test APIs quickly.

Keep your project simple; focus on working features.
